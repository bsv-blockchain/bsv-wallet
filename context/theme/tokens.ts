/**
 * Safari-inspired design tokens for BSV Wallet.
 *
 * Colors follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines.
 * Typography uses the iOS type scale (system font).
 * Spacing uses a 4pt base grid.
 *
 * INVARIANT — contrast pairs MUST stay readable:
 *   - `accent` ↔ `textOnAccent` (button bg vs button text)
 *   - `background` ↔ `textPrimary`
 *   - `backgroundSecondary` / `backgroundTertiary` ↔ `textPrimary`
 *
 * Never set `textOnAccent` and `accent` to the same brightness (white on white,
 * black on black). The light theme inverts colours from the dark theme — that
 * means BOTH theme objects must be updated when changing either field. A
 * runtime contrast check in `assertThemeContrast.ts` warns in dev if this
 * invariant breaks.

/**
 * The iOS type scale, which is very close to a 1.25 (major third) ratio anchored
 * on `body` at 17pt: 13 · 17 · 22 · 28 · 34 — each step ≈ the previous × 1.25.
 *
 * `display` continues that ratio one step past `largeTitle` (34 × 1.25 ≈ 42,
 * rounded to 44 to sit on the 4pt grid). It is for a single focal figure on a
 * screen that has one — an amount being handed to another person — and nothing
 * else. Two `display` elements on one view means the view has no focal point.
