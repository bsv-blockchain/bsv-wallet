/**
 * Spendable wallet balance for the send surfaces — the same figure the wallet
 * screen shows, read the same two ways: the cached figure immediately (so the
 * line never opens empty), then straight to our own SQLite rather than through
 * WalletStorageManager's FIFO reader lock (see storage/methods/walletBalanceSql
 * and the storage-lock notes in app/index.tsx). The wallet's own listOutputs
 * path stays as the fallback for the window before storage and the user id are
 * known. Refreshes on txStatusVersion bumps so a completed send updates it.
