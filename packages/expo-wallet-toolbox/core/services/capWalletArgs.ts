/**
 * Argument-size cap for wallets handed to EXTERNAL callers.
 *
 * Composed at each external surface exactly like guardVaultAccess: the in-tab
 * CWI bridge, the desktop-pairing WalletClient, and the saved-connection
 * WalletClients. Wrap outside the vault guard so a refusal costs nothing —
 * neither a permission prompt nor a storage touch.
 *
 * WHERE THIS MUST NOT GO. Not in guardVaultAccess, not in SimpleWalletManager,
 * not in WalletPermissionsManager, and not in the toolbox. The vault's K1
 * traffic is ordinary-sized today — a 25-byte P2PKH locking script and a
 * ~107-byte unlocking script per input — and would pass any limit here
 * unmodified. The exemption is kept anyway so the vault stays insulated from
 * any future tightening of these limits on the shared path.
 *
 * The vault is exempt STRUCTURALLY rather than by an originator comparison: it
 * calls managers.permissionsManager directly and never receives a capped wallet.
 * That cannot be spoofed by a caller presenting the admin originator, which
 * matters because the desktop-pairing surface constructs its WalletClient over
 * guardVaultAccess(manager, ADMIN_ORIGINATOR) — the admin string appears there
 * for the guard's own comparison, so keying an exemption on it would be reasoning
 * about the wrong thing.
