/**
 * Argument-size cap for wallets handed to EXTERNAL callers.
 *
 * Composed at each external surface exactly like guardVaultAccess. The current
 * app exposes desktop-pairing and saved-connection WalletClients; an embedding
 * host must wrap any additional bridge it adds. Wrap outside the vault guard so
 * a refusal costs neither a permission prompt nor a storage touch.
 *
 * WHERE THIS MUST NOT GO. Not in guardVaultAccess, not in SimpleWalletManager,
 * not in WalletPermissionsManager, and not in the toolbox. Vault transactions
 * carry roughly 45 KB R1C locks and up to 2.5 KB unlocks per selected input;
 * applying general bridge limits on the internal path could break them. The
 * exemption keeps the vault insulated from future tightening of those limits.
 *
 * The vault is exempt STRUCTURALLY rather than by an originator comparison: it
 * calls managers.permissionsManager directly and never receives a capped wallet.
 * That cannot be spoofed by a caller presenting the admin originator, which
 * matters because the desktop-pairing surface constructs its WalletClient over
 * guardVaultAccess(manager, ADMIN_ORIGINATOR) — the admin string appears there
 * for the guard's own comparison, so keying an exemption on it would be reasoning
 * about the wrong thing.
