/**
 * DEV-only convenience: run the whole vault stack against the software mock
 * YubiKey without hardware. Toggled from wallet-config (DEV builds only).
 *
 * In-session only — installs a MockYubiKey with a key already "inserted" and
 * a non-default PIN so enrollment does not force a PIN change. Clearing it
 * reverts getVaultDriver() to null (or the real native module, if present).
 * Kept in its own module so driver.ts never imports the mock.
