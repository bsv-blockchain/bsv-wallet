/**
 * Vault key derivation — pure functions, no I/O, no logging.
 *
 * V comes from the SAME mnemonic as the main wallet, domain-separated by a
 * non-empty BIP39 passphrase, and deposit addresses are plain BIP32 children:
 *
 *   main wallet    : HD.fromSeed(Mnemonic.toSeed(''))
 *   vault HD node  : HD.fromSeed(Mnemonic.toSeed(passphrase))
 *   deposit addr n : vaultHD.deriveChild(n)
 *
 * This replaces two earlier designs at once:
 *   - the second random 24-word mnemonic (the user now backs up ONE phrase)
 *   - the precomputed queue of 64 deposit key hashes in vault meta
 *
 * There is no xpub anywhere in this design, and nothing about the vault is
 * ever public at rest: the vault stores a YubiKey-sealed seed and a bare
 * `nextKeyIndex` counter, nothing else. Deposit address n derives from the
 * private HD node, which exists only transiently, after one of the two
 * recovery routes below reaches it.
 *
 * Recovery paths, and there are exactly two:
 *   1. YubiKey-unseal of the sealed seed  — the YubiKey unwraps the seed,
 *      which reconstructs this same HD node; nothing to type.
 *   2. main mnemonic + passphrase          — via this file; the same
 *      mnemonic and passphrase reconstruct the same HD node offline.
 * Both routes reach the identical HD node. There is no third path. Nobody
 * can reset it. Deposit address n derives on demand from that node, once
 * per unseal, however many indices are needed — unlike the old 64-key
 * queue, which failed closed until a privileged ceremony refilled it.
 *
 * SECURITY: never log the seed, the HD node, the mnemonic, or the passphrase.
