/**
 * Vault access guard (fixes the privilege-escalation review finding).
 *
 * PrivilegedKeyManager's key universe is the wallet's master HD root key — a
 * strictly more sensitive key than the per-app `primaryKey` (m/0'/0') that
 * every ordinary, non-privileged operation signs with. That is true whether
 * or not a vault is enrolled: the vault does not route through this manager
 * at all (vault inputs are signed from the vault's own HD node — the
 * YubiKey-unwrapped seed, equivalently derived from the main mnemonic plus a
 * vault passphrase that the root key cannot reach, since BIP39's `toSeed` is
 * one-way and passphrase-dependent). The toolbox routes every
 * BRC-100 `privileged: true` op through PrivilegedKeyManager regardless, and
 * this app runs with `seekProtocolPermissionsForSigning` / public-key-
 * revelation permissions OFF, so nothing else gates them. That let any web
 * origin, via the CWI bridge, use `getPublicKey({ privileged: true, ... })`,
 * `createSignature`, `encrypt`/`decrypt`, or HMAC ops to reveal or sign with
 * the root key — none of which are spend actions, so none of them ever trip
 * the spending-authorization sheet.
 *
 * Blocking privileged ops for external originators is what closes that
 * exposure: it is the only thing standing between a web page and the root
 * key, now that the keyGetter itself no longer discriminates by enrollment
 * or caller. (It is not what keeps the YubiKey ceremony admin-only — that
 * follows separately, because nothing outside `services/vault` ever calls
 * `requestVaultKey`/`ceremony.requestKey` in the first place; a page
 * cannot reach the ceremony through this guarded surface even in principle,
 * privileged or not.)
 *
 * Privileged operations have never been used by external origins in this app
 * (the keyGetter has only ever returned the root key with no ceremony and no
 * web caller — first because there was no vault, now because the vault no
 * longer routes through it either), so denying them breaks nothing real.
