/**
 * Encrypted chunk codec.

 * Sync chunks are dominated by raw transaction bytes — TableProvenTx.rawTx,
 * TableProvenTxReq.rawTx/inputBEEF, TableTransaction.rawTx/inputBEEF, merklePath — all
 * typed `number[]`. A naive JSON.stringify renders each byte as up to four characters.
 *
 * The toolbox's own binary-aware serialiser is used, but on its own it does NOT help here:
 * `binaryJsonReplacer` base64-encodes `Uint8Array` only, and the toolbox's own tables use
 * `number[]`, so those fields would pass straight through as decimal arrays. Hence the
 * packing pass below, which converts byte-valued arrays to `Uint8Array` first so the
 * serialiser can compact them, and converts them back on the way in.
 *
 * The server stores opaque bytes and never parses a payload, so this format is a purely
 * client-internal choice with no interop constraint.
