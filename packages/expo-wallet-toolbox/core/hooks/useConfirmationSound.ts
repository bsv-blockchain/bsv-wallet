/**
 * The app's tiny sound palette — the audible half of key money/security moments.
 *
 * Companion to `hooks/useHaptics.ts`, deliberately the same shape: a plain
 * module object you can import anywhere, plus a hook alias for symmetry inside
 * components. Fire-and-forget, and it never throws.
 *
 * Three rules, all non-negotiable, because these play in public:
 *
 *  1. RESPECT THE SILENT SWITCH. `playsInSilentMode: false` — a phone set to
 *     silent stays silent. An app that overrides the ringer switch for its own
 *     receipt noise is an app people mute permanently.
 *  2. NEVER MIX BADLY. `interruptionMode: 'mixWithOthers'` — these are sub-1s
 *     blips, not a media session. Ducking or pausing someone's music to
 *     announce a payment is rude and, on iOS, sticky.
 *  3. NEVER BLOCK, NEVER THROW. Every call site is `void`; every failure — no
 *     native module, an audio session another app owns, a decode error — is
 *     swallowed to a single dev warning. A silent success is still a success.
 *
 * expo-audio is required lazily on first play, so a build missing the native
 * module degrades to silence at the one moment it is used rather than taking
 * the module graph down at startup.
 *
 * Pairing rules (each tone pairs with exactly one haptic; never fire both a
 * tone's partner haptic AND the tone's own — Toast/Celebration already own
 * haptics.success for their moments):
 *   confirmation ↔ haptics.success   (money landed)
 *   vaultOpen    ↔ haptics.success   (vault unlocked after the ceremony)
 *   vaultClose   ↔ haptics.confirm   (vault relocked: timeout / unplug / manual)
