/**
 * Pushes wallet-database deltas to the encrypted backup log.
 *
 * Triggering mirrors TaskSendOffline: gated on the app's single online signal, with an
 * immediate pass when something changes and exponential backoff after failures.
 *
 * All state is static and process-global BY DESIGN. The monitor is torn down and rebuilt on
 * network switches and wallet rebuilds, and backup progress — particularly the backoff after
 * a failing server — must survive that. A per-instance version would reset its backoff every
 * rebuild and hammer a service that is down.
 *
 * The work itself is deliberately small. Monitor tasks run back-to-back with no yielding, so
 * a pass takes at most one chunk and the interval floor keeps it off the JS thread the rest
 * of the time.
