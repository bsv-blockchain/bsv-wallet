/**
 * Re-fetch a payment's proof from WhatsOnChain when the one the sender shipped
 * no longer verifies.
 *
 * A PeerPay token carries an AtomicBEEF minted at send time. Its merkle path
 * proves an ancestor against the block that contained it *then*. If that block
 * is later reorged out, the path is stale: the transaction is still perfectly
 * real and still has the same txid, but no chain tracker will confirm its root,
 * and `internalizeAction` rejects the whole thing as
 * "The tx parameter must be valid AtomicBEEF" — an error about the proof,
 * phrased as if the transaction were malformed.
 *
 * Re-fetching by txid repairs exactly that. What comes back is the same
 * transaction — the txid pins it, so nothing about the outputs, the amount or
 * the derivation can change under us — carrying whatever proof is current. The
 * sender is not trusted any further than they already were: we ask the network
 * for the ancestry of a transaction the sender named, and a mismatched or
 * unusable answer is discarded rather than passed on.
 *
 * This CANNOT repair the offline case. When `isValidRootForHeight` refuses
 * because the device has no network (OfflineFirstChaintracks.ts:55), a fetch
 * cannot succeed either — that payment is retryable later, not repairable now,
 * and `makeBeefRepair` declines rather than burning an attempt on it.
