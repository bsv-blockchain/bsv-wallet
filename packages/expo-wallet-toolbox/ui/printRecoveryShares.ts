/**
 * One-tap "print my recovery shares", shared by Settings, onboarding and vault
 * enrollment.
 *
 * WHAT THESE SHARES COVER
 *
 * For a wallet with a mnemonic, the shares split the mnemonic ENTROPY
 * (BRC-157). Any two rebuild the phrase, and therefore the seed, m/0'/0', the
 * everyday balance AND the vault. The printed sheet is seed-equivalent paper —
 * treat it with the same care as the phrase itself.
 *
 * For a wallet restored from legacy paper there is no mnemonic to frame, so
 * the shares split the raw recovered key, exactly as before. Those restore
 * spending authority only and can never open a vault. That cohort cannot
 * upgrade in place; their remedy is to sweep to a fresh wallet.
 *
 * 24-word phrases are refused: their entropy is 32 bytes, which fills the
 * split secret completely and leaves no room for the tag that tells the two
 * formats apart on recovery.
