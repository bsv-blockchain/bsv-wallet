// ChaintracksChainTracker, whose own isValidRootForHeight calls
// findHeaderForHeight with a 6x/250ms retry loop and throws on persistent
// failure (out/src/services/chaintracker/ChaintracksChainTracker.js:21-56).
// Passing an offline-first client as options.chaintracks alone therefore
// never reaches its store-first lookup. installOfflineChainTracker is the
