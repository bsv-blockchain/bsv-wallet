/**
 * Ceremony controller — UI-free state machine for the insert → PIN → tap flow
 * that unwraps the vault key. Consumed by a React context that renders the
 * ceremony sheet; kept free of React and native imports so it is fully
 * unit-testable against the mock driver.
 *
 * What a ceremony PRODUCES: the YubiKey is an unwrap oracle, not a signer. One
 * tap performs exactly ONE on-token ECDH (PIV KeyAgreement) against the seal's
 * ephemeral public key; that shared secret opens the sealed 64-byte vault seed,
 * which becomes an HD node and is then zeroized. The ceremony's product is that
 * node — a VaultKeyHandle — from which the spend path derives every K1 child it
 * needs, in software, with no further card contact. There is no per-digest
 * round trip and no signing on the card at all.
 *
 * Concurrency: one ceremony ARMING at a time — `requestKey()` calls that
 * overlap a single in-flight arm attempt (e.g. a deposit and its re-vault, or
 * two callers racing while `running` is true) share that one attempt and all
 * resolve to the SAME VaultKeyHandle; release() on it is idempotent by
 * construction, so whichever caller releases last simply no-ops. That guarantee
 * does NOT extend across separate ceremonies: once an attempt finishes arming,
 * `running` goes back to false, and the NEXT requestKey() call starts an
 * entirely new ceremony with its own handle — even if the previous one has not
 * been released yet. Two live, independently-armed handles can therefore
 * coexist for a stretch (see ceremony.test.ts's "late release() from a stale
 * handle" case); what is guaranteed is that a handle released late can only
 * affect its OWN subscription, never a successor's — see makeHandle's
 * `release()` doc for the one exception (the shared native transport).
 *
 * Session lifetime: arming means "the key is unwrapped and held", not "the
 * operation is done." A session-based transport's driver.stop() (which
 * dismisses the iOS NFC sheet) is therefore NOT called when the ceremony
 * completes; it moves to VaultKeyHandle.release(), so the session's lifetime
 * still brackets the caller's whole operation. The one exception is the error
 * path: if arming itself fails, no handle exists to own the session, so run()'s
 * finally closes it there.
 *
 * The retention window is now a ZEROIZATION BOUNDARY, not a convenience timer.
 * While a handle is armed, the vault key is live in JS memory; release() (or
 * the retention timeout, or a detach) drops the reference so the runtime can
 * collect it.
 *
 * Two caveats on that word "boundary", both deliberate and both bounded:
 *   - The window is refreshable. A post-arm progress note restarts it (see
 *     noteProgress), so an operation that legitimately outruns one window is
 *     not cut off mid-flight. It is NOT an open-ended lease: ARM_MAX_MULTIPLE
 *     caps a session's total life at 3× the window measured from `armedAt`,
 *     after which the relock fires however fresh the progress is. The
 *     boundary is therefore "at most 3× retention", not "exactly retention".
 *   - What gets dropped is a REFERENCE, not the bytes. The seed IS wiped
 *     (fill(0)) the moment the HD node is built, but the node itself cannot
 *     be zeroized — @bsv/sdk's HD holds the key as BigNumber/array internals
 *     with no wipe API, and Hermes may have copied them anyway. Dropping the
 *     reference is the best the runtime allows; this is the accepted residual
 *     risk the K1-only design documents. And the ceremony can only drop its
 *     OWN reference — see VaultKeyHandle on why callers must not keep one.
 *
 * SECURITY: the PIN lives in the arm flow's closure until release(), and the
 * unwrapped key lives in the handle for the same span. Never log the PIN, the
 * ECDH secret, the seed, the HD node, or a mnemonic — and never put any of them
 * in CeremonyState, which is React-visible.

   * `key-removed-mid-op` instead of handing back a key the ceremony considers

   * beyond its reach, which is why VaultKeyHandle's docblock tells callers to
   * read `hd` at each point of use and never to store it.
   *
   * `release()` drops the only reference this module keeps to the node, so the
   * runtime can collect it. It CANNOT zeroize it: @bsv/sdk's HD exposes no wipe
   * API and Hermes may have copied the internals anyway (the K1-only design's
   * accepted residual risk #1). The 64-byte seed the node came from is wiped in
   * unwrapVaultKey; the node itself is only dereferenced.
   *
   * release() is identity-checked against the controller's `activeHandle`:
   * whichever call reaches it first does the real cleanup — the transport
   * session AND, only if this is still the current handle, the shared arm
   * timer, activeHandle, and phase. That makes a handle released late (after a
   * successor has already armed) a no-op against the CONTROLLER's own state and
   * against the SUBSCRIPTION (each attempt owns its own KeyEventSession box, so
   * unsubscribing here can never touch a successor's listener — see
   * KeyEventSession).
   *
   * That scoping does NOT extend to the native transport itself:
   * `driver.stop()` (via the real adapter, `driver.ts`'s `adaptNative.stop`)
   * calls `native.stopDiscovery()` + `native.clearKeyListener()`, which are
   * process-wide — there is exactly one NFC/USB discovery session at the
   * native layer, not one per KeyEventSession box. A late release() on a
   * session-based transport therefore CAN silence a successor's still-open
   * native session even though it cannot touch the successor's JS-level
   * subscription or controller state. In practice this window is narrow (the
   * successor's own subsequent driver.start() reopens discovery), but it is
   * a real gap, not a theoretical one — do not read the subscription-safety
   * property above as a transport-safety one too.
