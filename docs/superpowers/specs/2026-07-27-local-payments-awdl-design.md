# Local Payments over AWDL — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Status:** Proposed
**Supersedes:** the BLE implementation on branch `bluetooth` (tip `5fc72a7`, removed from `master` by `ed454e9`)

## Summary

Phone-to-phone BSV payments between nearby devices, without exchanging identity handles.

Two transports behind one interface:

- **AWDL** (iOS↔iOS) — Bonjour + TCP over Apple's peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, no infrastructure required. Fast path.
- **QR** (any platform pair) — a single static QR carrying the signed transaction. Fallback and the only path involving Android.

Both are bootstrapped by the same QR code, so there is one user-facing flow.

## Why not BLE

BLE was the previous implementation and is now unavailable. `com.apple.developer.web-browser` prohibits `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`, while ITMS-90683 demands that exact key whenever CoreBluetooth appears in the binary — linkage-triggered, not usage-triggered. Confirmed empirically at both gates on 2026-07-27, with an appeal to Developer Relations already exhausted. The minimum surface (central-only, no `CBPeripheralManager`) was tested and still rejected. AccessorySetupKit does not escape it: its own API is typed in `CBUUID`, and it has no advertising role.

See `memory/project_web_browser_entitlement.md` for the full record.

AWDL carries no such exposure. `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` and `NSBonjourServices` are not on the prohibited list, and no entitlement is required.

**Superseded 2026-09-02.** The analysis above was correct for the app as it stood on 2026-07-27. The blocker was the entitlement, not Bluetooth: `com.apple.developer.web-browser`, its config plugin and the http/https URL types were removed in `de13669`/`1dc1d92` (2026-08-26, wallet-first pivot), so `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` can now be set and ITMS-90683 is satisfied rather than avoided. BLE has returned as the **third** rung of the ladder (AWDL → Nearby → BLE → QR), implemented as a second Nitro HybridObject `LocalPayBleTransport` behind the same `LocalPaymentTransport` interface this document defines, using the same per-session PSK from the QR to derive the GATT service UUID. AWDL and the QR fallback are unchanged. Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-ble-transport-and-qr-caps-design.md` (§"Why now", §2 `bsvpay-ble/1`, §5 ladder).

## Non-goals

- **Android as an AWDL peer.** AWDL is Apple-proprietary. Android participates via QR only.
- **Offline / chained unconfirmed spends.** Separate tech spike. This design assumes both devices have connectivity.
- ~~**Bluetooth, in any form.**~~ **Superseded 2026-09-02:** BLE is now the third rung — see the note under "Why not BLE" and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-ble-transport-and-qr-caps-design.md`.
- **Background operation.** Foreground only.

## Architecture

Four layers. Only the first is platform-specific.

### Transport interface

```ts
interface LocalPaymentTransport {
  readonly kind: 'awdl' | 'qr'
  /** Payee: begin accepting a payment for this session. */
  receive(session: Session, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<PaymentFrame>
  /** Payer: deliver a payment for this session. */
  send(session: Session, frame: PaymentFrame, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<Ack>
}
```

Transport selection is a pure function of the scanned QR and the local platform: AWDL when both sides support it, QR otherwise. No negotiation round trip.

## Pairing

The payee mints a session and renders it as a QR:

| Field | Bytes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `v` | 1 | format version |
| `caps` | 1 | bitfield; bit 0 = payee accepts AWDL |
| `sessionId` | 16 | random; becomes the Bonjour instance name |
| `psk` | 32 | random; TLS pre-shared key |
| `identityKey` | 33 | payee compressed pubkey |
| `amount` | ~5, **optional** | varint satoshis; **absent = open request, the payer chooses** |
| `derivationPrefix` | ~16 | BRC-29 nonce |
| `derivationSuffix` | ~16 | BRC-29 nonce |

≈ 120 bytes → a small static QR, instant to scan.

**`amount` is optional** (resolves open question 1 below). The payee either names a
figure or leaves the request open; on an open request the payer enters the amount on
their confirm screen. On the wire the key is *omitted*, never written as null —
`decodeSession` treats absent as open and refuses an explicit null, so the
"payer chooses" path can only be reached by a shape `encodeSession` actually
produces. Present-but-invalid stays a hard `CodecError`
(`Number.isSafeInteger(a) && a > 0`): degrading a corrupt `0` into "any amount"
would put a live Send button under a value nobody chose.

This changes exactly one check in the payee's settle path, and the distinction is
load-bearing:

| Check | Applies when | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `derivationPrefix` / `derivationSuffix` match | **always** | The nonces are the whole binding — they are the per-session values the payee minted and the payer echoed back, and matching them is what proves the frame was built for *this* request. Never conditional. |
| `frame.amount === session.amount` | **only when the payee named an amount** | It pins the figure the payee is about to read to the figure they asked for. On an open request there is no requested figure to contradict, so there is nothing to compare against; inventing a comparison would either reject every legitimate open payment or merely look like a check while always passing. |

The payer side mirrors this: `buildPaymentFrame` takes the amount as an explicit
argument rather than reading `session.amount`, so the single figure that becomes a
real output is chosen at one call site and cannot fall back to `undefined`
satoshis. It refuses a non-satoshi value, and refuses any value that contradicts an
amount the payee did name — before `createAction` runs, so a disagreement costs a
plain error rather than a `noSend` action holding inputs.

`sessionId` is rendered as base32 for the Bonjour instance name (`bsvpay-<26 chars>`), keeping it within DNS-SD label limits.

## AWDL path

**Payee** starts an `NWListener`:
- Bonjour service `_bsvpay._tcp`, instance name from `sessionId`
- `NWParameters.includePeerToPeer = true`
- TLS via `sec_protocol_options_add_pre_shared_key(psk, sessionId)`

**Payer** runs an `NWBrowser` for `_bsvpay._tcp`, filters to the exact instance name, connects with identical PSK parameters, and completes the handshake.

Then: payer sends one length-prefixed `PaymentFrame`; payee validates, persists, replies with an `Ack`; both tear down.

### Security

The PSK does the work. Only a device that physically saw the QR can complete the handshake, which gives mutual authentication and channel encryption from the OS — no hand-rolled crypto, and no plaintext BEEF on the air. This closes the "no encryption on the link" hole the BLE implementation shipped with.

Replay is bounded by `sessionId` being single-use: the payee stops listening after the first successful transfer and refuses a `sessionId` it has already settled.

**Threat not covered:** an attacker who photographs the QR before the payer scans it can impersonate the payer. They can only *send* money to the payee, so this is not a theft vector. Noted rather than mitigated.

## QR path

Used whenever either device is not iOS.

The payer builds and signs the transaction, then renders the `PaymentFrame` as a second static QR. The payee scans it.

Payload is the signed **AtomicBEEF** plus routing fields — the same encoding the AWDL path uses.

> **Amended during implementation.** This section originally specified a bare rawtx on the QR path, with the payee fetching ancestors by txid at internalize time, giving a ~350–450 byte frame. That is not what shipped, and the shipped behaviour is the correct one: a bare rawtx makes the payee's `internalizeAction` depend on network reachability at exactly the moment two devices may have chosen a local hand-off *because* connectivity is poor. Carrying ancestry keeps the receive side offline-capable and keeps one encoding across both transports.
>
> The cost is size: AtomicBEEF grows with input count, so a multi-input payment can exceed what a symbol will hold. `MAX_FRAME_QR_CHARS` (2,200 chars, `utils/localpay/codec.ts`) is the ceiling; the payer checks against it before rendering and reports `local_pay_too_large` rather than handing an oversize payload to the encoder, which would otherwise throw out of render. A single-input payment fits comfortably (v40 byte-mode holds 2,331 B at EC level M).

There is no ACK on this path. The payer's QR stays on screen until dismissed; the payee's snackbar is the receipt.

**Deliberately not doing:** broadcasting the transaction before handoff to shrink the QR to a bare txid. It would commit funds before the payee has received anything.

## Payload

PeerPay-shaped, so the receive side stays a standard `internalizeAction`. Protocol ID `[2, '3241645161d8']`.

```
PaymentFrame {
  version: u8
  senderIdentityKey: 33 bytes
  amount: varint
  outputIndex: varint
  derivationPrefix: len-prefixed bytes
  derivationSuffix: len-prefixed bytes
  transaction: len-prefixed bytes   // AtomicBEEF, on both transports
}
```

Binary, length-prefixed. **Not** JSON with `transaction` as `number[]` — that was a ~3.3× inflation in the BLE version and the origin of its 100 KB ceiling.

## Money safety

Unchanged in principle from the BLE implementation, which got this part right.

A received frame is persisted **before** any internalize attempt, so neither a crash nor a dead network can lose money that already crossed. `utils/localpay/pending.ts` lifts from `utils/ble/pendingPayments.ts` (211 lines, transport-agnostic, duck-typed).

- Storage: wallet `key_value_store`, key `localpay_pending`
- Statuses: `pending` → `processing` → `completed` | `failed`
- Retry triggers: on receive, on wallet build at next app open, on NetInfo offline→online

`internalizeAction` requires an online chainTracker (`@bsv/wallet-toolbox-mobile/.../internalizeAction.js:96` — `ab.verify(await wallet.getServices().getChainTracker(), false)`), so settlement is always deferred behind connectivity regardless of transport.

## Native module

`modules/local-pay-transport/`, authored with the Expo Modules API (Swift) to match Expo 55 / RN 0.83.6 / New Architecture.

Surface:
```
advertise(instanceName, psk) -> events: ready | connected | frame | error | closed
browseAndConnect(instanceName, psk, timeoutMs) -> connection handle
send(handle, bytes) / close(handle)
```

~400–500 lines Swift plus a TS wrapper. All public API — `Network`, `Security`. Nothing the App Store binary scan takes an interest in.

## Configuration

`app.json`:
- `NSBonjourServices`: `["_expo._tcp", "_bsvpay._tcp"]`
- `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`: replace the Expo Dev Launcher default currently shipping (*"Expo Dev Launcher uses the local network to discover and connect to development servers on your computer"*) with a real user-facing string. **This is worth fixing on its own merits** — shipping dev-tooling copy as a purpose string is a 5.1.1 exposure independent of this feature.

No entitlement. No background modes.

## Reuse and disposal

**Reuse from `bluetooth` @ `5fc72a7`:** `pendingPayments.ts`, the `WalletContext` retry hooks and NetInfo transition, the global snackbar in `_layout.tsx`, the screen's UI and i18n (242 lines of translations), token construction.

**Discard:** `utils/ble/chunking.ts` (TCP is a stream; QR is one frame), `central.ts`, `peripheral.ts`, `constants.ts`, `types.ts`, `hooks/useBLETransfer.ts` (453 lines the screen never used), `patches/munim-bluetooth+0.3.24.patch`, and both BLE libraries.

## Testing

- **Unit:** codec round-trip incl. malformed and truncated input; session mint/parse; pending-payment state machine incl. crash-mid-processing.
- **Integration:** two iOS devices, AWDL, airplane-mode-with-Wi-Fi-on and both-on-the-same-network; iOS↔Android over QR in both directions.
- **Failure paths that must be exercised, not assumed:** Local Network permission denied; payer walks out of range mid-transfer; payee backgrounds the app mid-transfer; duplicate `sessionId` replay; payee offline at receipt then internalizing on reconnect.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Local Network permission denied — feature is dead | high | Explicit UX, not a silent failure. Detect and offer a route to Settings. |
| AWDL flakiness when both devices are also on infrastructure Wi-Fi | high | Device testing before commitment; QR fallback is always available |
| Expo module + New Arch integration | medium | Public API only; spike the module before the screen |
| Guideline 3.1.1 — QR codes and crypto wallets as unlock mechanisms | low | Don't present this as unlocking content. Existing `handle402()` engages that far more directly. |
| iOS-only fast path is a two-tier experience | low | Accepted; QR keeps Android functional |

## Open questions

1. ~~Should the payee be able to raise a request with **no amount** (payer chooses)? The BLE version required an amount up front.~~ **Resolved: yes.** `Session.amount` is optional — see the Pairing table above for the wire shape and the one settle check that becomes conditional.
2. Retention policy for `completed` entries in the pending store.
3. Does the QR path need a payee→payer confirmation QR, or is the snackbar sufficient?
