/**
 * The restore step of the "import an existing wallet" flow.
 *
 * A recovery phrase alone cannot rebuild a wallet: change outputs carry a random
 * derivation suffix and BRC-29 receipts carry sender-chosen derivation data, none of it
 * on-chain. The encrypted backup log holds that metadata, so an import has to replay it
 * BEFORE the wallet is handed to the user.
 *
 * Two ordering rules are load-bearing, and both are why this runs where it does
 * (WalletContext's buildWallet, straight after `migrate` and before the monitor exists):
 *
 *  1. **Before this device's first push.** `pushOnce` writes under this device's own
 *     device id, and `restoreFromBackup`'s default target is the most recently updated
 *     device in the manifest. Let the monitor push once and the newest entry becomes this
 *     device's own near-empty log — restore would then replay nothing and report success.
 *     Belt and braces: this module resolves the target itself and passes it explicitly, so
 *     the default is never consulted even if the ordering slips.
 *  2. **Into a fresh database.** `restoreFromBackup` documents its storage argument as a
 *     fresh, migrated provider. Replay merges by record identity, so re-running it after a
 *     failed attempt converges rather than duplicating — but it is not a repair tool for a
 *     wallet that has already been transacting.
 *
 * Errors propagate. A partial or forked log must stop the import: a wallet that looks
 * healthy while missing the outputs it needs to spend is worse than one that plainly
 * failed to restore.
