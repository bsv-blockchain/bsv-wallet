/**
 * App-side adapter over `@bsv/backup-cache-client`.
 *
 * The wire client lives in the npm package (published from
 * go-private-backup-cache/ts-client) and speaks the server's stateless
 * per-request auth-proof protocol: one signed header per request, no
 * handshake, no session, so uploads and downloads stream end to end and the
 * server's blob cap is what GET /v1/limits says (200 MiB after the
 * transaction-storage-capacity work) rather than a constant baked in here.
 *
 * This module keeps the two app-specific decisions out of the package:
 *
 *  - IDENTITY. Requests authenticate as the backup pseudonym derived from the
 *    wallet's m/0'/0' key, never the wallet's identity key. The constructor
 *    takes the primary key and derives the wallet itself so no call site can
 *    accidentally hand the client the real identity.
 *
 *  - TIMEOUTS. The monitor awaits its tasks, so a request that never answers
 *    holds the task pending indefinitely — observed on device as BackupPush
 *    passes running past 100 seconds. Every request is bounded here; a backup
 *    is never urgent, and giving up until the next pass is strictly better
 *    than occupying the monitor.
